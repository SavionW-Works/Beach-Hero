# Beach-Hero
Beach Hero is a top-down arcade style game I made with two friends as part of the CUNY 2020 Hackathon. We were inspired to make the game after seeing all the trash strewn around NYC parks and beaches, and wanted to motivate others to keep these spaces clean. I helped program the controls, enemies, designed three levels and drew all of the in-game pixel sprites.
